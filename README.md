# Perse SDK iOS
From [CyberLabs.AI](https://cyberlabs.ai/).  
_Ready to go biometric verification for the internet._

The Perse CocoaPods SDK:
* Top notch facial detection model;
* Anti-spoofing;
* Feedback on image quality;
* Compare the similarity between two faces;
* Doesn't store any photos;
* [Camera](https://github.com/Yoonit-Labs/ios-yoonit-camera/) integration and abstraction;

For more details, you can see the [Official Perse](https://www.getperse.com/).

## About

This SDK provides abstracts the communication with the Perse's API endpoints and also convert the response from json to a pre-defined [responses](#responses).

> #### Want to test the endpoints?
> You can test our endpoints using this [Swagger UI Playground](https://api.getperse.com/swagger/).

> #### Want to test a web live demo?
> You can test our web live demos in the [CyberLabs.AI CodePen](https://codepen.io/cyberlabsai) or in the [Perse Oficial Docs](https://docs.getperse.com/sdk-js/demo.html#authentication-demo
). Do not forget your [API Key](#get-api-key).

> #### Want to try a backend client?
> We have some examples in `Python`, `Go` and `javaScript`.
> You can see documented [here](https://docs.getperse.com/face-api/#introduction).

## Get Started

### Install

1. Create a [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html). You may need install [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#toc_3) in your environment.

2. Add the following line to your `Podfile` file:

```
pod 'Perse'
```

3. And run in the project root the following command line:

```
pod install
```

4. Now, you can open and build your project with the extension `.xcworkspace`;

> #### How to create a  Xcode project with CocoaPods?
> TO create a Xcode project with CocoaPods you can see in the [Official CocoaPods Guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#creating-a-new-xcode-project-with-cocoapods).

### API Key

Perse API authenticates your requests using an API Key.  
We are currently in Alpha. So you can get your API Key:
1. Sending an email to [developer@getperse.com](mailto:%20developer@getperse.com);
2. Or in the Perse official site [https://www.getperse.com/](https://www.getperse.com/);

### Demo

We have a [Demo](/Example/PerseDemo)  in this repository for you:
* Feel free to change the Demo code; 
* Not forget to get your [API KEY](#api-key); 
* To run, the Demo, it is necessary to follow the [Install](#install) steps;

## Usage

### Face Detect

Detect allows you process images with the intent of detecting human faces.

```swift
import Perse
import PerseLite

func detect(_ file: String) {
    let perse = Perse(apiKey: "API_KEY")

    perse.face.detect(filePath) {
        detectResponse in
        debugPrint(detectResponse)
    } onError: {
        status, error in
        
        debugPrint(status)
    }
}
```

### Face Compare

Compare accepts two sources for similarity comparison.

```swift
import Perse
import PerseLite

func compare(
    _ firstFile: String,
    _ secondFile: String
) {
    let perse = Perse(apiKey: "API_KEY")

    perse.face.compare(
        firstFilePath,
        secondFilePath
    ) {
        compareResponse in
        debugPrint(compareResponse)
    } onError: {
        status, error in
        
        debugPrint(status)
    }
}
```

### Perse Camera

The Perse Camera:
* in essence, is the abstraction of the integration between the [PerseLite](https://github.com/cyberlabsai/perse-sdk-lite-ios) and the [Yoonit Camera](https://github.com/Yoonit-Labs/ios-yoonit-camera/);
* Must use the [PerseEventListener](#perse-event-listener);
* Works partially without an API Key;
* Must have a [API Key](#get-api-key) to receive the [Responses](#responses);

Here we have a example in code how to detect a face from a camera. See the complete code in the [Demo](/Example/PerseDemo) application.

```swift
import UIKit
import Perse
import PerseLite

class PerseCameraViewController:
    UIViewController,
    PerseEventListener
{
    @IBOutlet var perseCamera: PerseCamera!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
            
        self.perseCamera.apiKey = Environment.apiKey
        self.perseCamera.perseEventListener = self
        self.perseCamera.startPreview()
    }

    func onImageCaptured(
        _ count: Int,
        _ total: Int,
        _ imagePath: String,
        _ detectResponse: DetectResponse?
    ) {
        debugPrint(detectResponse)
    }
    
    func onFaceDetected(
        _ x: Int,
        _ y: Int,
        _ width: Int,
        _ height: Int,
        _ leftEyeOpen: Bool,
        _ rightEyeOpen: Bool,
        _ smiling: Bool,
        _ headVerticalMovement: HeadMovement,
        _ headHorizontalMovement: HeadMovement,
        _ headTiltMovement: HeadMovement
    ) {}
    
    func onFaceUndetected() {}
    
    func onEndCapture() {}
    
    func onError(_ error: String) {
        debugPrint(error)
    }
    
    func onMessage(_ message: String) {}
    
    func onPermissionDenied() {}
    
    func onQRCodeScanned(_ content: String) {}    
}
```

## API

This section describes the Perse SDK iOS API's, [methods](#methods), your [responses](#responses) and possible [errors](#errors).

### Methods

The Perse is in `alpha` version and for now, only the `Face` module is available.

#### face.detect

* Has the intent of detecting any number of human faces;
* Can use this resource to evaluate the overall quality of the image;
* The input can be the image file path or his [Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/data);
* The `onSuccess` return type is [DetectResponse](#detectresponse) struct;
* The `onError` return type can see in the [Errors](#errors);

```swift
func detect(
    _ filePath: String,
    onSuccess: @escaping (DetectResponse) -> Void,
    onError: @escaping (String, String) -> Void
)
```

```swift
func detect(
    _ data: Data,
    onSuccess: @escaping (DetectResponse) -> Void,
    onError: @escaping (String, String) -> Void
)
```

#### face.compare

* Accepts two sources for similarity comparison;
* The inputs can be the image file paths or his [Data's](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/data);
* The `onSuccess` return type is [CompareResponse](#compareresponse) struct;
* The `onError` return type can see in the [Errors](#errors);

```swift
func compare(
    _ firstFilePath: String,
    _ secondFilePath: String,
    onSuccess: @escaping (CompareResponse) -> Void,
    onError: @escaping (String, String) -> Void
)
```

```swift
func compare(
    _ firstFile: Data,
    _ secondFile: Data,
    onSuccess: @escaping (CompareResponse) -> Void,
    onError: @escaping (String, String) -> Void
)
```

> #### Tip
> We recommend considering a match when similarity is above `71`.
